# Mix-O-Logic - A cocktail recommendation website.

This is a responsive website that consumes an external Cocktail API from API Ninjas (https://api-ninjas.com/api/cocktail). Users can choose which endpoint to use (one filters by cocktail name and the other by ingredients). Website then displays the fetched recipes on flipcards - with ingredients on one side and instructions on the other.

I used vanilla Javascript, HMTL and CSS. The main challenge was the responsive design and I used flexbox to implement this effectively. I was limited by the design of the API and its endpoints - ideally the user should be able to filter the cocktail recipes by other paramaters (e.g. whether or not they are alcoholic) so I have decided to design my own API for my next project.
